App.java contains main.

Simply run main() and the program will print out the sought after answers
from the exercises.

Each class handles a group of exercises. For instance, the DiamondExercises
class handles all exercises related to the diamond.

The Helper class simply inserts asterisks or spaces where needed. A lot of
the exercises depended on this functionality so I thought it'd be best to
just make it a class on its own.

This assignment was approached using TDD, but have not yet been extensively
tested for invalid input.
